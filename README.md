Scrimba Project building an Image Carousel

DEMO: https://dillon-porter.github.io/carousel/

Built using HTML, CSS , and JavaScript without using a carousel API. 

In CSS we used @Keyframes to add a small animation through image transitions. 

Some JavaScript methods we used are: 
- classList.add()
- classList.remove()
- for of method ()

Some tweaks I added to this project:
 - Changed the arrow buttons to be transparent so you can view the images more
 - Increased the font size of the previous and next buttons
 - Removed the outline border on the buttons when clicked.
 - Changed the font-weight of the buttons to 700.
 - I also added my own images of 'Nature' instead of Movie images.
 - I centered the carousel to the middle of the page.
 - Added an autoplay feature of the images to 5 seconds.
 - Nav dots/indicators on the images to show users which image they are currently on.
 - This feature was added by adding the indicators function to the sliderposition[] similar to the previous and next buttons.
